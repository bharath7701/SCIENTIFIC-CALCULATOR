### Introduction
The **Scientific Calculator** is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing both basic and advanced mathematical operations such as trigonometric functions, logarithmic calculations, factorials, and square roots. The calculator is designed with responsive features and a modern look, allowing users to quickly perform calculations on any device.

### Summary
The calculator comprises three main components:
1. **HTML**: Defines the structure of the calculator, including buttons, input fields, and other elements. It links to external resources like CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality.
2. **CSS**: Styles the calculator, giving it a clean, 3D effect with soft shadows and modern button designs.
3. **JavaScript**: Implements the core functionality, allowing the calculator to perform mathematical operations and handle user input dynamically.

The calculator allows for various types of calculations, including trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), logarithmic (`log`), powers, square roots, constants like `π` and `e`, and even factorials.

### Input
The user interacts with the calculator by pressing buttons representing numbers and operations. These operations include:
- **Basic operations**: Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`×`), division (`÷`), and percentage (`%`).
- **Advanced functions**: Sine, cosine, tangent, logarithms, powers (`x^y`), square roots (`√`), factorials (`x!`), and constants (`π` and `e`).

The user can enter numbers and operators, either using the buttons or directly typing into the input field.

### Output
The output is displayed in the calculator's display field (`screen`). When the user presses the `=` button or an equivalent operation button, the result is computed and shown in the display. The results include:
- **Basic results** like `7 + 5 = 12` or `9 ÷ 3 = 3`.
- **Trigonometric values**, such as `sin(30)` or `cos(60)`.
- **Factorial calculations**, like `5! = 120`.
- **Logarithmic outputs**, such as `log(10)`.
